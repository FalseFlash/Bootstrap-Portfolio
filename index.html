                                   At just 13 years old I started making my way into the world of software engineering. I started with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic" target="_BLANK" rel="nofollow">Visual Basic 6</a> and created some small but simple programs, such as a cookie cleaner. Eventually I moved into VS.NET and made an mp3 audio converter, which at the time achieved a few thousand downloads. It was a huge success for my first ever publicly released program. The program actually made it onto a tech blog. I've tried to locate it again but unfortunately I cannot find it.

                                    In 2006 I started expanding to the web development world, starting with HTML and PHP. I dove right in, and I kept at it everyday for at least a year. In that time I was playing around with modifying forum software such as SMF and phpBB. But I didn't stop there. I've created some PHP based API scripts that connected to some game servers to retrieve information from the servers and also learned OOP along the way.

                                    For fun I've also created game modifications, which was written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque_(game_engine)" target="_BLANK" rel="nofollow">TorqueScript</a>. Some of my game modifications achieved over 20,000 downloads and was used by many servers for a period of time.

                                <p>And now fast forward to 2016, I'm attending <a href="https://codingbootcamp.rutgers.edu/" target="_BLANK" rel="nofollow">Rutgers Coding Bootcamp</a> to fill the gaps I'm missing, meet new people and finally make web devlopment of career of choice as it's something I really enjoy doing.
